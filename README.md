# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

A Web Application Vulnerability Scanner is a specialized software tool designed to automatically identify and assess security weaknesses in web applications. These scanners play a vital role in application security by simulating attacks to detect potential vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.

Core Functionality
At its core, a web application vulnerability scanner performs automated scanning of web applications to discover known and unknown vulnerabilities. It checks for flaws such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure authentication mechanisms, server misconfigurations, and exposed sensitive data. These tools mimic how an attacker might interact with the application, crawling through web pages, analyzing scripts, and sending malicious inputs to test system responses [2].

Key Features
Automated Detection: Scanners automatically explore web applications, analyze URLs, forms, and cookies, and attempt common attack patterns.

Real-Time Reporting: Many scanners provide real-time feedback, highlighting detected vulnerabilities along with risk assessments and suggested remediation.

Comprehensive Coverage: Modern scanners cover both static and dynamic aspects of applications, including APIs and complex JavaScript interfaces.

Ease of Integration: Many tools integrate into CI/CD pipelines, enabling developers to identify and fix issues early in the development cycle [3].

Importance in Cybersecurity
Given the growing dependence on web-based services, applications have become prime targets for cyberattacks. A single unpatched vulnerability can lead to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage. Web vulnerability scanners provide a proactive approach to mitigate such risks by identifying weaknesses early in the development lifecycle or in production environments [4].

Types of Scanning
There are generally two types of web application vulnerability scanning:

Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyzes source code or binaries for flaws without executing the program.

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Examines applications during runtime to simulate real-world attack scenarios.

Popular Use Cases
Security Compliance: Helps businesses meet standards like OWASP Top 10, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

Continuous Monitoring: Enables regular security assessments to ensure applications remain secure over time.

Risk Management: Assists in prioritizing vulnerabilities based on severity and potential business impact.

Tools and Implementation
Popular tools include open-source options like OWASP ZAP and Nikto, as well as commercial products like Burp Suite, Netsparker, and Acunetix. These tools vary in complexity, pricing, and features but generally aim to provide automated, accurate, and scalable vulnerability assessments [3].

In conclusion, web application vulnerability scanners are indispensable in modern software development and cybersecurity practices. They provide a cost-effective, efficient, and continuous way to secure applications, minimize attack surfaces, and maintain trust with users and stakeholders.

## Features

- Tests URL parameters for SQL Injection vulnerabilities using common payloads.
- Tests URL parameters for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting script payloads.
- Uses `requests` for HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library

## Installation

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the scanner script and provide the target URL with parameters when prompted:

```
python scanner.py
```

Example target URL:

```
http://example.com/page.php?id=1&name=test
```

The scanner will test each parameter for SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities and print the results.
